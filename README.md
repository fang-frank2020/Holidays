# Holidays Across the World

Demo on https://fang-frank2020.github.io/Holidays/

## Brief Description: This webpage lists a chronological timeline of the holidays in a chosen country. The timeline starts on the current date and lists holidays until the end of the next year. Additionally, each holiday has a accompanying description and image, and the background color of the timeline is a gradient that matches the season of the holidays.

#### Motivation: I wanted to create a webpage where people could read about all the different holidays for a given country in one place rather than having to go through google calendar and manually search up holiday names and their descriptions. Additionally, I wanted to create this webpage, so people of different cultures could get a sense of upcoming holidays in different countries. It was hard to juggle between my American and Chinese identity and know when different holidays were coming up for either culture. As a result, this webpage solves this problem in that there is a dropdown feature where you can select various countries and view their respective holidays.

#### Improvements for the future: In the future, I hope to be able to implement a feature where you can combine the holoidays of different countries into one big timeline. Currently, the webpage only displays the holiday timeline of one country at a time, but for multicultural people, it would be hard to go back and forth between one country and another country. In addition, for many of the holidays, the api that I used could not find images and/or descriptions of the holiday, so I hope to improve my image/description search.

#### Challenges I faced: There were numerous challenged I had to overcome in this project. Firstly, this was my first time using APIS and RESTAPIS, so I had to learn the nuances of fetching data from APIS and learning how to read json files. Additionally, I had trouble sorting holidays by date. I originally used a dictionary where the key was the holiday date and the value was the holiday name, so when two holidays were on the same day, my program would be unable to access which one was first chronologically.
